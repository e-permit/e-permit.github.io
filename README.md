## Implementation

### Managing Digital Keys

> Each party should manage own configuration about other parties

**Authority Config Sample**

```https://e-permit.gov.<country code>/config.json```

```json
{
    "id": "ua",
    "title": "Ukraine",
    "authorities": [
      {
        "id": "tr",
        "title": "Republic Of Turkey",
        "keys": [
          {
            "kty": "EC",
            "use": "sig",
            "kid": "1",
            "crv": "P-256",
            "x": "kKUBDGuy-smxA6omYlXBotSzPVB6qKI2jRe1x9U4_kE",
            "y": "5q8JKBbFoiNuDDibs7h5zIohNvDiG70UJKq4E4n51Kg",
            "alg": "ES256"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

### Issuing Credential

- Issuing authority signs credential payload with own private key
- Issuing authority sends credential information to verifier authority
- Issuing authority generates a qr code with credential info for driver 

### Verifying Credential

- Verifier officer scans qr code or types credential identifier by using *universal verifier app* or *private app*)
- For offline mode app verifies digital signature and shows result
- For online mode app checks credential status by an api call and show result
- App can send used credential request by api call

### Rest Api

- ```/credentials```: post a credential into verifier database by issuer(self contained auth) 
- ```/credentials/{id}```: get a credential info and status by hash value 
- ```/credentials/{id}/revoke```: revoke credential by issuer(with a jwt token generated by issuer)
- ```/credentials/{id}/used```: change credential status by verifier officer(auth required)

> **id** is credential hash
